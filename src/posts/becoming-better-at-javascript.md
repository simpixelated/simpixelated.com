Over the past year I've spent more time writing JavaScript than doing just about anything else. I thought I would do a link-dump of some of the resources that I've been using to get better. I try to watch at least one [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/simpixelated/stars) a week. I thought this one in particular on Test Driven Development was great: \[inline_media\]

<script class="speakerdeck-embed" type="text/javascript" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js" async data-id="4fa986b3a117fc00220012ed" data-ratio="1.33333333333333"></script>

I've also been doing a lot of reading:

- [Understanding JavaScript Object Oriented Programming](http://killdream.github.io/blog/2011/10/understanding-javascript-oop/)
- [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)
- [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/)
- [Functions Explained](http://markdaggett.com/blog/2013/02/15/functions-explained/)

I recently served as a tutor for two people I met over craigslist who wanted to learn more about using Wordpress. Without knowing exactly what they needed to know going in I tried to prepare a general overview of how to develop a Wordpress theme. But as it turns out, the "students" were on two very different levels, both far below what I was trying to teach. I talked a little too much and too long about template heirarchy and the Wordpress codex. But once we started talking about their exact problems it was easy to provide quick answers. I think it worked out well and I hope I can do it again!

Here's a list of the links that I provided them for future reference:

**Official Documentation**:

- [Official Wordpress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/)

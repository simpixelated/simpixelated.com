## What I'm up to now

### Doing

I’m currently really excited about local active transportation advocacy with the [Carmel Transportation Party](https://carmeltransportationparty.org/). Myself and a few other local advocates are trying to gather supporters of urbanist principals: living, walking, and biking safely to work, school, and shops.

- I was [on the news](https://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/carmel-roundabouts-facing-a-major-change) advocating for 20 MPH speed limits entering/exiting roundabouts
- I met with key city stakeholders to discuss constructing a new mile long [bike path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmqCMsSQ76Y) in the center of the city
- I’ve [spoken at city hall](https://www.youtube.com/live/SSIetRhAEmQ?si=ft7Zzqk4FOvKNJXY&t=4271) in favor of zoning reform to enable more multi-family development

We moved to Carmel in 2023 to live car-lite and we’re doing it! We bought a cargo bike and ride it to school, groceries, and other errands on a daily basis.

### Reading

- Trying to finish [Around the World in 80 Trains](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40122009) (it's great, I just don't prioritize books right now)
- Just checked out [Haruki Murakami Manga Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124825303-haruki-murakami-manga-stories-1) from the library

### Watching

- Tokyo Vice - loving it despite the [allegations against the lead actor](https://www.vulture.com/2022/04/ansel-elgort-sexual-assault-allegations-timeline.html)
- Adored everyone on [Love on the Spectrum](https://www.netflix.com/title/81338328?source=35) season 2
- Thoroughly enjoyed [Blue Eye Samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Eye_Samurai)

### Playing

- I think I might be done with Ghost of Tsushima after probably 40+ hours. Fantastic game! Completed the main story and the DLC
- Currently restarting the BG3 campaign for the 3rd time. I’ve played acts 1 and 2 twice already, but I can’t seem to finish act 3. Not sure why, but I’m enjoying trying out new builds. Currently doing a Dark Urge (durge for short) with a Drow Oathbreaker Paladin. It’s presenting a lot of crazy, evil choices that is fun to see after being a pretty morally good character in my previous play-throughs.

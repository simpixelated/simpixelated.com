I've been playing around with MongoDB for [IPOfest](https://github.com/simpixelated/ipofest). It's a perfect match for a JavaScript developer because you can just store and access straight JSON.

FirstÂ [install Homebrew](http://simpixelated.com/install-homebrew/ "Install Homebrew for OS X"), then in the terminal run:

```
brew update
brew install mongodb
```

That's it! Pretty simple huh? If you want to actually run it, including creating databases, read more in the [official MongoDB documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/).

These links have been sitting in my bookmarks for months now. There's a lot of tutorials, documentation, and free books. Many are resources that I still reference regularly, especially when developing a new feature or app, or whenever I run into a problem.

### Learning JavaScript

- [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) - free book by Addy Osmani, probably the book I've studied the most this year
- [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#object) - fantastic documentation on some of the advanced features/quirks of JavaScript
- [Functions Explained - Mark Daggett's Blog](http://markdaggett.com/blog/2013/02/15/functions-explained/) - deep dive into functions and how they are used to scope

### Backbone

I use Backbone on a daily basis and love it. It certainly has it's problems; mostly that it's so un-opinionated you'll spend a lot of time just deciding on the "best" way to handle something. But it is amazingly flexible while still providing excellent structure, especially when combined with Marionette.

- [Official Backbone Documentation](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/) - I probably visit this on a daily basis
- [Getting Started with Backbone.js | Nettuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/getting-started-with-backbone-js/)
- [What is a model? - Backbone.js Tutorials](http://backbonetutorials.com/what-is-a-model/)
- [Developing Backbone.js Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/) - another free book by Addy Osmani, probably my second most referenced resource this year
- [A pragmatic guide to Backbone.js apps](http://pragmatic-backbone.com/) - brand new book in progress, have't read all of this one yet

### Architecture and Build Process

Having been introduced to Grunt and RequireJS, it's hard to imagine starting another project without them.

- [RequireJS Fundamentals](http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/13-05-08/requirejs-fundamentals.aspx) - good intro to RequireJS by the KendoUI team
- [Package Managers: An Introductory Guide For The Uninitiated Front-End Developer](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1190/package-managers-an-introductory-guide-for-the-uninitiated-front-end-developer) - good intro to npm (node package manager) and bower
- [Meet Grunt: The Build Tool for JavaScript | Nettuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/meeting-grunt-the-build-tool-for-javascript/) - now that you understand package managers, use them to automate your testing and build process
- [Yeoman - Modern workflows for modern webapps](http://yeoman.io/faq.html) - now that you understand the build process, use scaffolding to setup new projects
- [Single page apps in depth (new free book)](http://singlepageappbook.com/index.html) - if you're creating your first or second SPA, this is a great resource
- [The client-side templating throwdown](http://engineering.linkedin.com/frontend/client-side-templating-throwdown-mustache-handlebars-dustjs-and-more) - great break down of the pros/cons of many JavaScript template libraries by the LinkedIn dev team.

- [Haters gonna HATEOAS — Timeless](http://timelessrepo.com/haters-gonna-hateoas)

### CouchDB

You've probably heard of MongoDB, but it's not the only NoSQL option available. CouchDB is another document based database that can be easily interfaced with using JavaScript.

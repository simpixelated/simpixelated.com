Well, it took a year for me to recover from my blog being hacked, but my blog is finally back. A lot has happened since my last post. I got married to my best friend, I started a blog about the [Fiat 500 Abarth](http://www.fiat500abarth.us "Fiat 500 Abarth Blog"), and I moved (down the street). After my blog was hacked I decided it was easier and more productive to turn simpixelated.com into a permanent resume. It has served me well, but I'm currently at a job I love and I want to start blogging again.

At [SiteGoals](http://blog.sitegoals.com "SiteGoals Blog") we have a lot going on, that's for sure. We're creating a project management application that will help our current business, but we think its so good that we can sell it to other agencies like ourselves. So that consumes much of my thoughts during the week. It took several years, but we're finally at the point where it actually does something very useful and we're getting close to launching a very limited beta, hopefully by the end of the year. So we've started to look into marketing and the whole launch process, which thankfully, has been covered by hundreds of very successful application developers already.

I'm also finally making a little bit of money from blogging, all with AdSense on my blog about the Fiat 500 Abarth. It definitely took a significant amount of time to set up and develop to the point it is now, but at this point it literally requires no time to continue to make money. However to make it grow, I still have to invest an hour a day or so on content development, or improving the design, or social media marketing. But it is essentially at the point where it is cruising and it only requires additional effort if I want to grow it larger, which is great. I'm now looking into how to replicate the minor success into multiple blogs so that I can start to build a portfolio of passive income. Exciting times indeed!

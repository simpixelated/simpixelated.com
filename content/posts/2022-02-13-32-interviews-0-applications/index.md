Last year, in a span of about two months, I managed to get thirty five interviews for Software Engineering positions without filling out a single application. I made it to the final stages with seven companies, received four offers, and eventually accepted an offer that doubled my previous total compensation! In this post I'll explain how I did it.

The fall of 2021 and continuing through to the spring of 2022 has been an insanely hot job market. Between the "Great Resignation", massive shift to remote work, and software continuing to eat the world, the demand for software engineers is sky-high. Senior software engineers have always been in high demand, but with almost every position being 100% remote during COVID and many likely to continue post-pandemic, senior engineers are even more coveted by companies unwilling to put in the work to mentor junior developers (lame). If you have at least 4-5 years of experience and haven't had a significant pay raise recently, now is the time to explore the market.

I was extremely happy with my [previous position](/two-year-work-retrospective), but I felt like I had hit a ceiling for growth. The comfort of my job was an excellent B.A.T.N.A. I would only be willing to accept an offer that was a dramatic jump in both compensation and career growth opportunity. I wasn't desperate. Without any stress in my day job, I had a higher bandwidth for the stress of interviewing. I wanted to line up multiple offers at once, to ratchet up the leverage and [negotiate the best compensation](/always-negotiate-your-salary) possible. With these goals in mind I set out on my job search.

##### Avoiding the Job Application Black Hole

The typical job application process is a complete waste of time. You have to submit the same basic form, over and over again, usually without ever getting a response, with the hope that you are lucky enough to stand out among the hundreds of other applicants. Each application takes at least 30 minutes because:

- most of the time you have to enter everything manually, despite also uploading your resume
- you can't copy and paste because each line is a separate form field
- you're still supposed to craft unique answers for each job posting, in hope of getting past the initial screen

If you're lucky, you'll get a quick rejection. Most of the time however, you won't hear back until long after you've already accepted an offer somewhere else, if you hear back at all. The entire process is mentally and emotionally draining.

This time I was inspired by the course [How Social Media Can Land You Your Dream Job](https://egghead.io/talks/egghead-how-social-media-can-land-you-your-dream-job) by [Taylor Desseyn](https://twitter.com/tdesseyn). I've also taken [How to find your Dream Job](https://buy.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/dream-job/) by Ramit Sethi in the past. I decided it was time to apply everything that I had learned and flip the job application process on its head. I wanted to have the jobs come to me.

##### Using LinkedIn Messaging As My Job Portal

Following Taylor's course, I updated my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simpixelated) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordankohl/) profiles with a good picture, a nice looking banner with some additional info, and tweaked my bios and headlines to match the keywords I knew recruiters would be looking for. Then I turned on "looking for work" on LinkedIn and the flood gates opened. As a software engineer, I have been messaged by recruiters on a regular basis. But nothing like this. I went from a couple of messages per month to 15-20 per day.

Note: my experience may not match yours, even if you follow the same steps. The job market might be different by the time you read this. I had over 12 years of experience in front end development, which is particularly in-demand at the moment. I'm a white male with a European last name. All these things likely helped me skip ahead in addition to the proactive steps I took.

With so many messages to respond to, I had to get systematic. Initially, I just said yes to everything that wasn't an immediate turn-off. But as I started doing interviews, I had to be more selective with my time. Before I even started, I knew that my ultimate goal would be to work for a public company (something I had never done before). But, considering I didn't have a college degree and I wasn't up to date with LeetCode algorithm trivia, I thought that might be impossible. So I came up with a criteria that could fit both private and public companies:

- $210K base salary
- 25+ days of PTO
- 100% remote now and forever
- 401K with some matching
- maximum 40 hour work week
- minimal travel (less than 10%)
- 100% medical/dental/vision coverage and some dependent coverage

Initially, I kept this to myself. I was following the negotiation strategy of avoiding anchoring yourself too low by naming a number first. Eventually though, I started giving this list to recruiters if A) I hadn't heard of the company they were pitching or B) it didn't sound like a good fit from their initial message. This way, I wasn't completely rejecting potential fits, but I was further streamlining my pipeline by skipping companies that couldn't get anywhere close to matching my criteria. I always responded quickly, even if it was a simple "no". LinkedIn makes this a simple two-click process by automatically generating a polite response for you. I've heard that the time to respond can affect your ranking in LinkedIn search results. Either way, most recruiters appreciated the timely response.

##### Rolling the Snowball

I was able to build momentum with each interview I accepted. My scheduled started to fill up with initial screens and eventually middle and late-stage interviews. I openly shared this info with each recruiter, which led to quicker scheduling going forward. Instead of waiting weeks to go through multiple interview stages, I was able to get it scheduled and completed within a few days.

In the end, I made it to the final stages of interviews with seven different companies. Of those, four gave me formal offers. There were many others along the way that despite being great companies and opportunities I would have died for earlier in my career, that I declined to move forward with because I already had some great offers.

#### Offers

It took me 12 years, but I finally managed to land multiple offers at the same time, including my first offer from a public company. It’s partly a culmination of my experience, but also a sign of the times. Never in the past would I have been able to skip so many applications with recruiters. I would have burned out in the process of applying. Instead, I had to turn down many interviews and only really burned out towards the end of multiple half-day “virtual on-sites”. So I only started slowing down when I had multiple final interviews completed.

Having competing offers skyrocketed my total compensation past what I was expecting. Prior to that, I was basically getting my current salary +10-20% and some funny money equity. It wasn't until Twilio entered the chat that I had an offer with RSUs that I could convert to real money as soon as they vested. All the other offers were from startups that had plans to go public, but that could have been years in the future, if it ever happened. Regardless, I was able to play one large startup with an equity offer against a public company with real stock. I held that distinction a secret until I was asked about it explicitly. But at that point they had both already upped their offers to double my current total compensation.

##### Lessons Learned

More preparation: interview practice, studying algorithm questions, studying graphs, big O notation, studying the company I was interviewing with (I did a bit). I used the interviews as practice, but I totally bombed the technical screens for some of the companies I was most interested in.

Some of the best feedback I received was:

- The first item on your resume is what everyone is going to read. They might go a little further down the list, but not much. So make sure the first couple accomplishments under your most recent job are what you want to talk about. I had listed a WordPress plugin I developed (in React). Several interviewers assumed I was big into WordPress.
- I was told via the external recruiter that I didn’t sound technically experienced enough. Despite having 12 years of experience and coding daily, I came across as more of a manager than an individual contributor. This is partially because my previous two positions were in management, so I think people already made assumptions about me and I didn’t do enough to sway their opinion. I realized I needed to go in with more technical details (depending on the audience of course) and show my enthusiasm for coding.

It’s important to be able to craft a narrative about your experience, whether it’s a decade of professional experience or your first job. Considering how little time you have to explain your entire life story, it’s important to be able to condense important details into an arc that is interesting to listen to. Every question you answer should reinforce that story, whatever it is.

Ultimately, working with recruiters via LinkedIn messaging made this the least stressful job application process I've ever experienced. I was spending so much time filtering out potential opportunities that I simply didn't have time to apply on my own. I didn't need to. I'm really happy how it all turned out and I hope this helps you do the same.

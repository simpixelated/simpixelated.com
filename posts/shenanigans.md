We drove into the rising sun. Few travelers joined us on our twilight journey. My jaw ached from being sucker punched the night before by an obese, drunk Mexican while sitting in a Jack-in-the-Box drive-thru. My stomach was a cauldron of various spirits, still bubbling from the night before. My eyes, my brain and the rest of my body burned from the lack of sleep. She told me she felt the same. But we were determined, destined for adventure--a drive straight up the mountain as the sun rose over its peak. We decided on a whim to drive to Tahoe, on zero hours of sleep. We arrived in town at 8, booked the first hotel we could find and slept until the late afternoon. We enjoyed some good food, a walk on the strip and the beach, then came home the next morning. It was exhilarating and exhausting at the same time.

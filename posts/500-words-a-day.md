Part of my [One Step At a Time](http://simpixelated.com/one-step-time/ "One Step at a Time") program is to write something everyday. Produce instead of consume. [Karen](http://www.goofycancook.com) and I have set a goal of writing 500 words every day. <!--more-->I was inspired by this TED talk:

To me, the hardest part of writing is just getting started. Once you have a topic, writing should be as easy as thinking. The problem for me in the past was that I edited myself too much. I'd think about every word before I wrote/typed it, because I wanted perfection from the first draft. By forcing myself to write 500 words every single day, I usually have to resort to writing a stream of conscious. Using [Write Or Die](http://www.writeordie.com) also helps with that, because you can't stop to think.

We mark each day off on a big calendar in our office, which is a nice visual reminder to not [break the chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret). I've been saving most of what I write as blog post drafts, but I don't know which ones will ever see the light of day. They definitely need some editing.

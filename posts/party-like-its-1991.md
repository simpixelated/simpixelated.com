I'm finally moving into the new millennium by buying a car built in it. I'm downgrading from two turbos to one, removing six cylinders and saying goodbye to two hundred horses in the process. But I'm also losing some weight and girth, and gaining a lot of "practicality". Yes, I'm giving up the third pedal. Unfortunately I'm committed to commuting for the foreseeable future, so I want a car that's comfortable to sit in and easy to drive, especially in the hell of stop and go traffic. 

That doesn't mean I'm throwing in the towel and moving one-step closer to a minivan! No, not yet. I won't have more than two doors (and no the hatch doesn't count) and my wheels will still be at least seventeen inches wide. My new car will even have a sport mode and "flappy pedals". It has launch control. I can turn traction control off. The muffler still growls on occasion. I will still beat most people off the line. I will own the hottest of the hot hatches!

The real reason I'm [selling my car](http://austin.craigslist.org/cto/1755074282.html) is that I can't stand it any more. I love the car on Sunday afternoon, with the t-tops down and the wind in my hair. I love it on Monday night when the traffic breaks up early and there's plenty of room to put the throttle down. But for 90% of the time I'm in the car, I hate it. I hate going sideways over speed bumps and still scratching the bottom, I hate feeling every pothole and dip in the awful roads here in Austin, and I hate clutching and feathering the throttle a hundred times on my way to work. I'm tired of the creaks, the leaks, the bumps and all the worry the comes with having a nineteen year old car. 

So for now, its time to party like its 1991 and enjoy the Z while I still have it.

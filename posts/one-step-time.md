Too often I get caught up in lofty goals which are impossible to achieve. I set the bar so high that I give up before taking a single step (I know, I'm mixing metaphors left and right). On top of that, I spend way too much time consuming and not enough time producing. I'm addicted to Google Reader. I have too many subscriptions. I can't tell you how many amazing tutorials and articles I've read, bookmarked and stored for later, that I've never come back to. What good is that information? Well instead of storing that knowledge up like a chipmunk, I'm going to start producing again.

I'm going to plan less, or at least plan for shorter and smaller goals. I want to be proactive and not plan so far ahead that I never reach my goals. Really my checklist is very simple. Every day I want to learn something, build something, and write something. I'm hoping each one leads to the next. We'll see how I do.

I took [Kyle](http://aquaether.com/blog/), with his bag of photographic goodies, out and about in Austin with me just a few weeks ago. On his first ever car shoot, he took some great shots of the Z! Click on the first picture to see a whole set that I tweaked a little in Photohop. While the main goal was to get some better shots for the [cars.com ad](http://www.cars.com/go/search/fsbo_search.jsp?affiliateadid=4776003&affiliate=national), we managed to get some nice parting shots to remember my first car by. Soon to come: photos of the new car!

On Tuesday I drove a couple hours to visit my aunt and uncle for one day and attend freshman orientation at [Sacramento State](http://www.csus.edu) the next two. I learned all about my major: Graphic Design, and registered for my first semester of classes. It was all pretty exciting and I look forward to August 28th, which is when I move into the dorms. In the meantime, I have [Necrowombicon](http://www.pacult.com/nwc.php) to look forward to, which is only **15 days away!**

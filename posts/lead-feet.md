Despite being a [fat tire](http://www.newbelgium.com/beers_ft.php), I still feel more in shape than most of the people I see slogging along the river trail. I think the three years of cross country and two years of track in high school conditioned me enough to hold me over even through my lazy college years, where bad eating habits are running rampant. At least that's what I like to tell myself. One thing that has never been very well groomed is my stride. You know how some people are described as having a rolling gait? I have the opposite of that. My gait is similar to a steel-booted robot, stomping, marching angrily towards a calculated destination. I have heavy feet, or something. I can't help it.

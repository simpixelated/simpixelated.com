I suppose I should update this "blog". Time flies as the saying goes, so I haven't been keen on writing stuff down. What's new in the life of Mr. Sim you ask? Well I have been reading financial/motivational books as of late. Namely _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_, _The Richest Man in Babylon_, and _Conversations with Millionaires_. If you haven't read them yourself, I really recommend you do; great books! I am also seriously investigating cologne for the first time in my life. I've been playing a lot of the _Settlers II_, _NBA 2K7_, and I fell in love with _Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks_ (even though I was expecting to get_ Deadly Alliance_; the guy gave me the wrong game, but I'm not complaining because _Monks_ is much better than I ever expected from an _MK_ game). New Years was actally pretty great this year. That is all.

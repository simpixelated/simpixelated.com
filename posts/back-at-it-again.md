Kobe Bryant: "Talented. Amazing. Brilliant. Douchebag." - [Hardwood Paroxysm](http://hardwoodparoxysm.blogspot.com/2008/02/special-announcement-march-11th-kobe.html)

In case you are unaware, which I am sure you are, yesterday was "Kobe Bryant Blog Day". This was an unofficial (or as official as a blog is) dubbing by Hardwood Paroxysm (which I only discovered yesterday). The idea behind it all was that whether you love or hate Kobe, he is an amazing player that deserves a little praise every now and then to balance all the hate he does get.

Obviously I am a huge fan of #24 and have been ever since he donned a Lakers jersey alongside Eddie Jones and Nick Van Excel. I tend to agree with the quote though. Kobe's passion for winning combined with his immaturity have led to the debacles of the Shaq feud, the Phil feud, the Colorado trial, threatening to leave during his free agency, basically sitting out the second half of game seven against the Suns, and most recently requesting to be traded this summer. But despite all that junk, I still would rather have him on the Lakers over Shaq or anyone else.

Some other highlights from Kobe Bryant Blog Day:
> Sactown Royalty: "Clearly, Matt has never visited Sacramento. We poisoned his burger before a playoff game! We named him the #2 most evil Laker of all-time! Though I'm not proud of it, we invented the COL-O-RAD-O! chant... In Sacramento, we hate Kobe Bryant. But you know what? Of course we respect his game. Of course we can appreciate his talent."
This guy went nuts and posted 24 Kobe Bryant blogs in 24 hours. A little too obsessive even for me, but the videos are worth a look if nothing else.

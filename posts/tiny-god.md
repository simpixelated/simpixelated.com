After an arduous, irksome haitus, I am officially back on solid computing ground. For a mere $600, I was able to build a mean machine for college. It runs Morrowind like a dream, so I have been playing that a lot for the past couple days. On Thursday I finally broke down and bought a hub, so I am now accessing the net over a shared 56k connection. Talk about speed! Fortunately I only have to endure this for one more month, after which I will be intravenously hooked up to a sweet 10-million-bits-per-second drip.

Few things in life can make me more delighted and content than curling up on my bed, with the warm body of my favorite person, to watch the Lakers absolutely dismantle the Rockets (who were _mis_combobulated). The Kings should take notes on that game. Kobe Bryant, walked into the arena a few minutes before the game, rubbed his eyes, and played brilliantly, and I called it. Of course, it wasn't much of a prediction considering the other two times he has come straight from court to a game he scored the game-winner vs. the Nuggets and 35 points against the Kings, respectively.

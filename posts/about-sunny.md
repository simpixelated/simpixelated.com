Sunny was a proud dog, the proudest I've ever personally known. A couple pats, a couple scratches was all she needed to be content with attention. Her independence was not to be confused with negligence however, as the Jacksons doted on her like a third child. She enjoyed the finest table scraps (including her choice of cheeses, of which provolone was not one), long walks around a neighborhood built for dogs, and the love of a fine family. Although I poked fun at her stature, I was always pleasantly surprised by her friendly demeanor in the face of such slights. She was a good dog that I shall not forget.

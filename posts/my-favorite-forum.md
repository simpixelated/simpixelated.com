Obviously I use Google Reader, I keep up on lots of RSS feeds. I read blogs, news websites, Twitter, all the usual suspects. But by a wide margin, I find the majority of my useful information from a more unexpected source: the [Something Awful forums](http://forums.somethingawful.com/). I was a fan of the website back when it first started and after "lurking" in the forums for a long time I finally bit the bullet and paid the $10 fee to get an official membership. Since then I've checked it almost daily, staying up to date on a number of different subjects. That is the wonderful utility of the forums, they have so many members that there is a thread for just about any topic you could imagine.

For web design, I keep the [Wordpress thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3161913) bookmarked at all times. If I ever have a question about themes that Google can't answer, this is where I go for answers. In fact the [whole coding forum](http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=202) has a wealth of useful information.

Since I just bought a new GTI, I keep up on both the [VW/Audi Question&Answer Thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3298776) and the [2.0 FSI Tuning Thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2795316) (that's the engine). If you have an even remotely sporting car, chances are there's a thread for your make/model. Sometimes there might even be an official rep from a dealer or manufacturer that chimes in with very useful information.

I'm playing Fantasy Football this year (go USC Boosters!), so I'm now following the [Week 1 Sit/Start thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3345324) (I'll have to bookmark week 2, etc.) and [Fantasy Football 2010](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3319289). Even if I have a very specific question about which player I should pick or start/site, its likely that someone else will have the exact same problem and has already asked the question and had it answered. Like I said, there are just so many members of the forum, there is a wealth of useful information available.

Be sure to look for [free magazine subscriptions](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3279595), find some [hilarious comedy podcasts](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3335405) to listen to, [catch up on what you've missed](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3328496) since you stopped collecting Legos, and see some beautiful [automobile photography](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3295777).

Trust me, if you can think of a topic, you'll probably find it buried somewhere within the Something Awful forums, where a group of nerds are discussing it fervently. I'm sure you'll lurk for awhile before realizing that $10 is nothing and it will be worth it to get rid of the annoying ads, bad language filter, and have the ability to actually contribute something yourself.

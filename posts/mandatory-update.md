Things I liked today.

*   [The Animatrix](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0328832), which featured 9 storylines far better than the one found in Reloaded.
*   [Day of Defeat](http://www.dayofdefeat.com/), which has replaced TFC as my Half-Life mod of choice.
*   Receiving the Big Lebowski shirt I ordered off eBay.
Things I didn't like.

*   Raking leaves (this is a never-ending job) in the summer heat.
*   Having nothing to eat. I recall eating a banana at some point.

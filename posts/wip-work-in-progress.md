As you can see, this blog is still a WIP. I'm planning to put my portfolio and resume back into Wordpress. I'm actually thinking about changing "Portfolio" to "Projects" to allow me to better encompass all the work that I do. To me, Portfolio represents finished work and usually is more design oriented. As a Front-end Developer, I tend to work with sites that have most of the design already done. Not to mention some of my best work is in projects that aren't "done" either because they were shelved or we're waiting on the client, etc. Also projects is a little more informal, allowing me to simply blog about my work instead of waiting to formalize everything.

I'm using a free theme, which is fairly sparse, so I'll try to add some color and icons and bits of design here and there to spruce it up. I don't want to take much away from the content, but it needs some love.

In the meantime I'll be making sure my sitemaps, analytics, and basic SEO is up and running. Just installed Wordpress SEO by Yoast, now moving on to some contact forms (maybe Wufoo), Disqus, etc. Any other suggested plugins?

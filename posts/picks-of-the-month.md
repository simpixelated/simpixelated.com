Just like everyone else, I am a total media whore. Seeing as how I don't have a regular job right now (web design pays good enough to live at home with your parents for the summer), I have plenty of time to entertain myself with books, movies, music, tv, and the Internet. So without further ado, here are my _picks of the month_:

**Song of the month**: definitely Times Like These by the Foo Fighters. I have always liked the Foo Fighters, but their new cd has brought a greater appreciation for their music. Times Like These is a satisfying, melodious rock song with some good rises and falls in the tempo and intensity. Check it out if you haven't already.

**TV show of the month**: Without a doubt Family Guy. Stupidly, I never really watched the show when it was on Fox, but thanks to the geniuses at Cartoon Network who have picked it up (among other animated gems), I am discovering its true greatness.

**DVD of the month**: I rent scores of DVDs, since I have a subscription to Netflix (might as well get your moneys worth, right?). My most recent rental was [The Frighteners](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0116365). I had seen it before and remembered liking it, but after watching it again it has completely renewed my love of Peter Jackson, who wrote and directed it. This movie is hilarious, beautiful, frightening, fresh, and just all around magnificent. It features the best looking death character, ever. When he comes flying down and slams the ground with that massive scythe, it sends shivers down my back. Probably one of my favorite movies of all time (The Big Lebowski, Blues Brothers, and Fight Club are also up there).

**Website of the month**: [Daydream Graphics](http://www.daydreamgraphics.com/tutorials/list.php?cat_id=2) (the PHP Tutorials), since I borrowed their code to build most of this site. Perhaps not the greatest set of tutorials to start learning PHP with, but certainly helped me leap to the next step in the learning process. I feel quite a bit more capable after reading them and constructing this site, which features three MySQL tables, an admin page that lets me update the blog, hassle free, and obviously, a lot of PHP code.

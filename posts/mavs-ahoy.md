Wow, I never thought the Mavericks would actually win game 1 in San Antonio. Just goes to show you how much the Spurs choke at the end of almost every game.

Okay, so the 49 free throws helped the Mavs get to the end, but Duncan missed 2 key free throws at the end as well as that last airball. After letting the Mavs comeback from 18 down and coming up extremely short at the end, the Spurs don't deserve to win a championship.

Perhaps now my dream of a Nets/Mavs finals isn't too far off!

I think I just may want to be a writer.

As you can tell I am not very certain about the subject. Since before I even started college I have wanted to be a web designer and I still love web design. But the best path for me to become one is no longer available to me. Whether because of my own ineptitude, laziness, or some strange twist of fate, I was unable to pass the required lower-division courses necessary to become an official Graphic Design major in my two-and-a-half years at Sacramento State. At this point it seems silly to keep trying.

So for the past couple months I have been waffling between alternate majors in my mind. Although Journalism has always been my fallback choice, I just came to a realization today that I actually hate the news and never want to become a journalist in the classic sense. I want to write for a magazine, write a script, design video games, and talk about sports. I do not and will not cover the news. I am beginning to think English is a major more suited for me. The vast amount of classes required for the major is indeed daunting, but with a focus in Creative Writing I think I will enjoy it far more than I would a class on copy writing, or the ethics of Journalism. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I also think a BA in English holds a little more weight and a lot more potential career diversity than a BA in Journalism.

So for now, in the imaginary registration office in my head, I am an English major. Wish me luck in my new path of study! Now I just need to start writing.

<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->I love [my job](http://www.post.ca.gov); I'm _re_learning PHP and getting paid to do it! I just found out today that the sample database I'm building is going to turn into the actual database they use. Originally they just wanted me to see how feasible it would be to plop this gigantic Word document/small telephone book into a database but it has turned out so well that they want me to keep designing the entire thing. Since they don't have PHP on their normal servers (and most of them don't understand what it is), they gave me my own server to host it on. I feel bad for whoever ends up converting this thing into ASP two or three years down the road.

Since John (another student intern) left I haven't worked on a project this big, so it's great to be able to do something more than just cut and paste text changes on HTML pages. Aside from just designing and filling the database, I'm also creating user pages to display and sort the information and admin pages to let people who have no idea what PHP or MySQL are edit, add, and delete everything in the database. Honestly, aside from [the Cult](http://www.pacult.com) I think this is the biggest project I have been a part of and I am pretty much the only one doing the work, which is both daunting and thrilling at the same time.

**Artist of the Month:** Benefit is without a doubt, the artist discovery of the month, probably the year, for me. I only heard a couple of his songs once and the next day had to buy his CD. It comes on a CD-R. He makes it with a mic and a soundcard. And it kicks ten times more ass than any other rap CD in existence. But if you're an anti-rap type person, please don't knock it until you've tried it.

Imagine beats like Jurassic 5 with lyrics like [MC Frontalot](http://www.frontalot.com). This isn't irrelevant, un-relatable gangster rap, this is nerdcore hip hop. He has a song about freeing the music to the people via Napster, beating Super Mario Brothers, and what he'd do with a midget. Go check it out on your favorite peer to peer program, he probably wouldn't mind. If you really like it, you can buy it on [Indelibility.com](http://www.indelibility.com).

_Thanks to Chuck for introducing me to Benefit._ He might kill me if I don't say that.

**DVD of the Month:** [Best in Show](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0218839). I didn't bother to see this when it came out in the theaters, because I thought it would be all about Dog Shows and it wouldn't be funny. Turns out it's all about Dog Show _people_ and it's hilarious! Everyone who hasn't seen this, go rent it now. Everyone who has already seen it: well, you already know.

I watch way too much television. I used to be pretty disciplined: _The Office_ and _Lost_ were pretty much my only indulgences. But _Lost_, _The Sopranos_, and _Entourage_ are all back at the same time and I just can't stop watching any of them, no matter how far many people think they've fallen. The more I cook the more I want to pay attention to _Iron Chef_ and _Good Eats_, which really are the only good shows on the Food Network. Somehow I got sucked into watching the second half of _The Apprentice_ this season (Stefani is the only one left that I wouldn't like to see fired, although Frank is very entertaining). Karen got me addicted to _America's Next Top Model_, which I pretty much consider The Natasha Show (for those who know). Oh and I can't forget _Ugly Betty_. Plus I just bought season one of _Arrested Development_ on DVD. Do I have a problem?

If you make a comment on this post, you have to include your list of currently watched programs (i.e. still in production) so that I can compare.

_Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!_

The [newest information](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraftexp1/news.html?sid=6155696) about the World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade expansion actually has me excited about the game again. I haven't really played in over three weeks and I'm currently in the process of liquidating all my non-60 character's inventories on the auction house. The upcoming patch pretty much killed any hope I had of the game becoming fun, since the promised revitalized World PvP is really just a bunch of collection quests combined with voluntary PvP in zones no one cares about. But the expansion supposedly has an entire zone devoted to outdoor PvP complete with towns that can be bombed, captured, and held. Not to mention that the two new racial mounts are a war elephant and something called a cockatrice, which I imagine to be a giant chicken. Now that seals the deal for me.

[Mike Bibby](http://www.nba.com/playerfile/mike_bibby/index.html) and I are pretty much best friends for life now. Karen and I were walking back from class and we saw him just standing around by a car, dressed to play basketball. I said "What's up Mike?" and he was like "Hey". Yeah, we're pretty tight now. We have no idea what he was doing at our lowly state school, because college basketball season hasn't started and there was no event going on that we know of. Karen thinks he is just always dressed to play basketball, headband and all. Funny as that may be, I think it could very well be true.

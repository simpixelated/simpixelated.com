- In less than two weeks, I'll be able to witness the greatness of Kobe Bryant (the basketball player, not the jerk) and be able to stare up at the championship banners in the Staples Center!
- After being addicted to The Sims 2: University for a short stint, I'm now playing ESPN NBA 2K5 exclusively. Yes, I'm running the Lakers franchise.
- I really, really, **really** want to go to [PAX](http://www.penny-arcade.com/pax/index.php) this year.
- My bank account is running desperately low. I can probably afford a couple more tanks of gas and enough sandwiches to finally get one free from the Safeway deli. After that I'll have to get a job I suppose.
- I'm actually learning something in my Computer Science class, which is surprising. Perhaps I'll actually start attending class now.

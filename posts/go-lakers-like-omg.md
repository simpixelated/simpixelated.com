On a completely opposite note, there really ought to be an All NBA Announcers Team (Nate knows). It would consist of Marv Albert, Kevin Harlan, Charles Barkley, the Czar, Mike Fratello. I'm sick of listening to Al Michaels slowly build up a completely superfluous stat, meanwhile missing the most exciting plays of the game. ABC shouldn't have let him out of the Monday Night Football booth. Doc Rivers is decent, but I'd rather have him coach. What the networks really need to do is utilize their staff and switch the post-game announcers with the in-game announcers. Charles Barkley, and hell, Torny Kornheiser and Mike Wilbon could make any game entertaining (i.e. the East is boring).

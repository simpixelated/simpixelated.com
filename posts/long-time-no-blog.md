Birth. School. Work. Death. That's how my cynical co-worker paraphrases life. Sometimes I have to agree. So many things happen on a daily basis, but when I sit down to write about them, all I can think to say is, "School. Work." I guess the biggest news is that my girlfriend, moved away to start her own business. It is definitely sad times around here without her. I pretty much spent all my free time with her everyday up until a week before she left. So it has been very weird without her, sort of like we're both on vacation or something. I want the time until I visit her to pass by as quickly as possible.

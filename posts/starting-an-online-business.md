I've been doing a lot of research, reading, and thinking about how to make money online. I know its the magical pot of gold that everyone is searching for, but I really feel that with all my knowledge of web design and development I can come up with something that would really fill a niche need and help me start making some passive income. I just don't know what that is yet. But some great sites that I have found that are helping me are:

*   [StartupFreedom.com](http://www.startupfreedom.com/) - this is a blog with a lot of great articles as well as interested video interviews with entrepreneurs who have made it big doing some kind of online business.
*   [I Will Teach You To Be Rich](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/) - this one is more personal finance, but it does have some great posts on making money online.
*   [Mixergy](http://www.mixergy.com/) - just started checking this out the other day. It has tons of video interviews (with transcripts) of other successful players in the online money-making business. Its really surprising how many different businesses that you haven't even heard of are making millions of dollars each year.
*   [Killer Startups](http://www.killerstartups.com/) - a daily list of 15+ ideas for online start ups. This makes for great inspiration.

For the first time home buyer in San Diego (as I am), it can be hard to find a modern, energy efficient, single family home for less than $500k. Especially when you also want some acreage (as I do). So I'm considering having a house built, in a year or two. I want it to be energy efficient, possibly net zero, possibly passive, and possibly capable of being off the grid. I also want it to be somewhat modern, to look good, and be high quality. All of that is hard to find at a decent price. Which is why I started looking at prefab and modular homes.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">My search started with </span>[Prefabulous + Almost Off the Grid](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419703250/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1419703250&linkCode=as2&tag=simpixelated-20), which includes lots of beautiful examples and plenty of references. <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Combined with my own research, I've put together a list of the prefab/modular home builders in the United States. I've included the location and year founded, when it was easy to find.</span>

All of these are "affordable" to some extent. All of them have floor plans of at least 1,200+ square feet and I'm not including cabin kits or anything else that's too small to be livable for a family of three.

This is a pretty exhaustive list, but if there are any I'm missing, please let me know. I plan to investigate these further, starting with their price per square foot and which options that have available.

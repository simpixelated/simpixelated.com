The LAN party was a complete success! Tycho made good on his word, as [Armagetron](http://armagetron.sourceforge.net/) turned out to be the new favorite. We also played a little Tribes and quite a bit of TFC. Hopefully we will have some huge (compared to our normal 8 person deals) LANs later this summer. We have plans to rent out a building, bring in a bunch of chairs and tables, and have a cover charge. The geeks in our county will flock to it like Yogi to a picnic basket!

In other news, I am having a lot of fun learning/building with PHP. I created the registration form/list for Necrowombicon 2K3 today and it only has me wishing I could do more!

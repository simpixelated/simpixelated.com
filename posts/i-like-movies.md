[Stanely Kubrick](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Kubrick,%20Stanley) is a genius. For those of you who have already come to this conclusion: I'm sorry it took me so long. I guess I just wasn't paying attention. For those of you not in the know: Stanely Kubrick is the main man behind such cinema classics as _A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, and 2001: A Space Odyssey_, which I watched today, for the first time. All hail [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com).

My opinion: Greatest. Movie. Ever. First I was bewildered by the opening 5 minutes of a black screen accompanied by a booming, ominous symphony. Then the credits rolled. For the next 2/3 of the movie, I enjoyed finally seeing first hand all the scenes that have become part of the sci-fi lexicon. Then the final part of the movie literally blew my mind. I was criminally insane for a few moments, then my lunacy lessened and I was able to continue functioning at a low level of normalcy. I stumbled to my computer chair and searched for some kind of explanation on the Internet. Fortunately, as you would expect, there is a plethora of devotion to _2001_ and I quickly found a [good essay](http://www.modemac.com/2001/) on the topic.

Now I think I will watch it again. Then I'm going to rent more Kubrick goodness. You are advised to do the same. Oh and if someone would buy me [this](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005ASUK/qid=1056526053/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_3/002-5600726-4072045?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846), it would be greatly appreciated.

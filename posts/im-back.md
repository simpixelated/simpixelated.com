Some bad people found the backdoor to my database and basically wiped it out, however thanks to daily backups by the server manager, I was able to get my site restored. It was actually fixed about a week ago, but I have been really busy with work, classes (especially Japanese), and life. When I manage to find some free time, I have been playing a great new WWII RTS, [Company of Heroes](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/companyofheroes/review.html). Oh and [The Hidden](http://www.hidden-source.com/), a mod for HL2. Check them out, I promise you won't be dissapointed.

### History

Like many other developers struggling to find time to work on side projects, I've started but never finished refactoring my blog from WordPress to just about anything else, many times over the years. Here's just a few of the frameworks I've tried out:

- React.js
- Gatsby 1.0
- Next.js 5.0
- headless WordPress with custom static export
- Gatsby 2.0 - 5.0
- now Eleventy

Read about how and why I decided to switch from Gatsby.js to Eleventy in my [recent blog post](TBD).
